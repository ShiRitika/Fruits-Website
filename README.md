# Store Website

## Poject Desrciption:

Fruits Store Website is a single page Application made of using Javascript's very popular library React-js with TypeScript using Material-UI. It have a Navbar at the top of application which have links to route on different pages(you can route on Home, About, Store). it contains clickable Add to cart buttons , and having many products to explore. In this project mainly focused on Typescript and Shopping cart using Redux.
Shopping carts are one of the most common things to build as a web developer, but there is a lot that goes into building a good shopping cart. In this project I had mentioned how to build a fully functional shopping cart using React, TypeScript, and Material-UI. This is a great intermediate level project.

## Technology Used:
- React JS : React JS is a Javascript library used to develop the application.
- TypeScript : TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing. This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
- Material-UI : Some Material-UI components like Icons, Grid, Badge, Typography , MakeStyle, Button, Styled is Used.
- Javascript :
- JSX : Javascript XML is used to structure the page.
- Material CSS : MUI makestyle is used to style the page and make it more beutiful and attractive.
- Basic CSS: used to provide basic comfortability to website.
- Redux:  It allows React components to read data from a Redux Store, and dispatch Actions to the Store to update data.
- React-Toastify: This tool allows you to add toast notifications to your application with ease and can also be used to set notifications and alerts.
